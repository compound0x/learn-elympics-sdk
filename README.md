# learn-elympics-sdk

A simple two-player Rock, Paper, Scissors multiplayer game built in Unity with the Elympics SDK for server-authoritative gameplay and Web3 integration. Players select a move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors), and the server determines the winner, ensuring fair and synchronized results. The game supports matchmaking and can log results on-chain for leaderboards or rewards.
